# Left 4 Dead Autoexec
My personal Left 4 Dead Autoexec i ported over time from my Left 4 Dead 2 one [Here](https://github.com/crustySenpai/Left-4-Dead-2-Autoexec)<br/>
Bhop can be found [Here](https://www.gamemaps.com/details/19343)<br/>
Recording Helpers can be found [Here](https://github.com/ProdigySim/recording_helpers)<br/>
Note: I recommend to only use them in Singleplayer however it does work Online.

Uploaded it mostly for Backup Purpose but planned for a while now to release it too.
